Contiguous Product
==

In this problem, you are given an array of integers. Write a program to find the maximum product of a contiguous range in this array.
For example, if the input array is `[2 -2 3 4 -6 -7 4]`, your algorithm should return `2016`, which is the product of the range `[3 4 -6 -7 4]`.

Implement your solution in the contiguousProduct in solution.hpp, This function takes in the input integer array and return the largest product of a contiguous subarray. You may assume that the input array is never empty.
